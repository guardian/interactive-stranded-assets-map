                    <p>In a business-as-usual scenario, the researchers estimate the world would have $25trn of fossil fuel assets by 2036. The US, Russia and Opec countries would have the largest reserves of coal, oil and gas.</p>

                    <p>With net zero policies coming into effect, and demand for oil and gas declining, Opec countries may choose to increase production and sell fossil fuel assets at a high price while they still can.</p>

                    <p>This would devalue fossil fuel fields and infrastructure elsewhere. For example, 62% of US assets would be stranded compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Similar crashes are likely in other oil exporting nations.</p>

                    <p>In another scenario, Opec accepts quotas to prevent the fire sale of fossil fuels. This would still lead to about $11tn of stranded assets, although these losses would be distributed more evenly among producer countries.</p>

                    <p>Despite the loss of fossil fuel assets in this net-zero scenario, the world economy would still grow by $44tn by 2036 - or 3.9%. Russia and China would see the value of their fossil fuel assets fall, but their economies would still increase overall.</p>

                    <p>The outlook for developing nations is even rosier, with countries including Argentina, Kazakhstan and India projected to record double-digit economic growth.
